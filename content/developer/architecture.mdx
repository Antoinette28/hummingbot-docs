![Connector Architecture Diagram](connector-architecture-diagram.svg)

The **_Architecture Diagram_**, given above, depicts the high-level design of a Connector.

## Directory and File Structure

Each exchange connector consists of the following files:

hummingbot/market/<market_name> # folder for specific exchange

- market.[pyx,pxd]
- auth.py
- data_source.py
- order_book.[pyx,pxd]
- order_book_tracker.py
- active_order_tracker.[pyx,pxd]
- user_stream_tracker.py
- in_flight_order.[pyx,pxd]

## Component Overview

Each exchange connector is comprised of the following components.
Below are the detailed descriptions of tasks for each component and its corresponding files

| **Market**<br/>`*_market.pyx`<br/> _REQUIRED_ | Connector modules are centered around a `Market` class, which are children of [`MarketBase`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/market/market_base.pyx). Each `Market` class contains a separate `OrderBookTracker` and `UserStreamTracker` to pass along changes to the relevant order books and user accounts, respectively.<br/><br/>`Market` instances also contain a list of `InFlightOrders`, which are orders placed by Hummingbot that are currently on the order book. Typically, it is also helpful to have a market-specific `Auth` class, which generates the necessary authentication parameters to access restricted endpoints, such as for trading. |
| **MarketAuth**<br/>`*_auth.py`<br/>_OPTIONAL_ | This class handles the work of creating access requests from information provided by Hummingbot. Arguments tend to include:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

                                                            - HTTP Request Type
                                                            - Endpoint URL
                                                            - Mandatory parameters to pass on to the exchange (e.g. API key, secret, passphrase, request body)

                                                            Depending on the specific exchange, different information may be needed for authentication. Typically, the `Auth` class will:
                                                            - Generate a timestamp.
                                                            - Generate a signature based on the time, access method, endpoint, provided parameters, and private key of the user.
                                                            - Compile the public key, timestamp, provided parameters, and signature into a dictionary to be passed via an `http` or `ws` request.<
                                                            - **Note**: This module is typically required for centralized exchange only.  Generally, auth for DEXs is handled by the respective `wallet`.
