## Order optimization enhancement with multiple orders

We improved the `order_optimization` parameter to work with multiple order levels. (More explanation here). See [Order Optimization](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/order-optimization/) page for more information.

## Performance Fee Calculation

When there are multiple fee token, display a list of the fees on `history` command.

## Disable balance limit from client

Previously, `balance limit` can only be disabled by editing the global config file. In this release, users can now run the command and set it to a negative value to disable from inside the Hummingbot client.

While setting it to 0 will initially not place any order for a specific asset until a trade is executed to accumulate the said asset.

See [Balance Limit](https://docs.hummingbot.io/features/balance-limit/) page for more information.
