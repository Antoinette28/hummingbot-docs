## Version 0.20.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.20.0! In this release, we mainly addressed a number of bugs. Separately from the `hummingbot` client, the team has been hard at work on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure, with campaigns on target for a mid-February launch.

### ü§ñ UI Update

- We have added a feature that allows you to encrypt and decrypt your exchange API keys. Please review `Step 3: Configure a market making bot` in our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.hummingbot.io/quickstart/configure/) for more details.

### üåä‚õè Liquidity mining update

In mid February 2020, we plan to launch liquidity mining campaigns for our launch partners on 0x Mesh and Binance. There will be approximately US \$3,000-\$8,000 per month in rewards for liquidity miners to earn in each campaign.

Also, we recently released a blog explaining how liquidity mining rewards are calculated on our new platform. For more information, read through our blog posts:

- [Liquidity Mining Launch Update](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2019-12-liquidity-mining-launch/)

### Version 0.19.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.19.0! In this release, we focused on working and testing upcoming connectors along with addressing identified and reported bugs.

### üìä Important update on UI

- We have created a consistent interface for all trading pairs on different exchanges, which means when you configure your bot,
  You can enter "BASE-QUOTE" (e.g. ETH-USDT) for your trading pair input on any exchange.

  However, this means you have to edit all of your old config files and replace any trading_pair / symbol inputs to the new
  format.

### ü§ì Developer usability

### üöÄ Coming soon

Here's what we currently working on that we expect to ship in the next 2-6 weeks:

- Additional documentation on adding new connectors into Hummingbot
- Developer tutorial on building custom strategies
- [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) connector
- [Bitcoin.com Exchange](https://exchange.bitcoin.com) connector

**Introducing Liquidity Mining**

We also announced a new **liquidity mining platform**, a digital marketplace for liquidity. Read more about it here:

- [Introduction to Liquidity Mining](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2019-11-liquidity-mining/)
- [Liquidity Mining Whitepaper](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-mining.pdf)

The team will be focusing in the coming weeks to realize and roll out this new platform.

## Version 0.17.1

This release is a hotfix to version [0.17.0](/release-notes/0.17.0).

- Added a fix to correctly mount conf directory in docker

## Version 0.17.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.17.0! This release includes the launch of a Bittrex connector, developer documentation for custom strategies, and improvements to the portfolio performance calculation. We also continued to address reported and identified bugs.

### üîó New Bittrex connector

Hummingbot now supports [Bittrex Global](https://global.bittrex.com/)! Bittrex is a global, centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in Seattle, USA. It is an intuitive and easy to navigate exchange platform often finding its way into the top 3 US exchanges in terms of trading volume.

Read more about how to use Bittrex connector with Hummingbot in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/bittrex/).

### üìä New performance analysis calculation

We redesigned how Hummingbot analyzes performance so that events unrelated to Hummingbot‚Äôs actions (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, manual trades) do not impact the performance calculation; percentage profit is now based solely on assets spent and acquired from trading. Refer to our document in [Performance Analysis](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/commands/history/) for more information.

### üìù More developer documentation

We published a developer tutorial on building custom strategies and documentation for the **Perform Trade** strategy.

- [Developer Tutorial](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/tutorial/)
- [Perform Trade Strategy](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/tutorial/perform-trade/)

### üìöLog file management / data storage

- A separate log file will now be generated daily. When a new log file is created, if there are more than 7 files, the oldest ones will be deleted in order to limit disk storage usage.
- AWS free tier provides 7.7GB of disk space. Ubuntu files take about 1.1 GB, Docker takes about 0.4 GB, and hummingbot image takes about 2.5 GB. This leaves about 3.7 GB for the logs and data files, which should be enough, especially now that we have set up log rotation. Refer to [Amazon Web Services](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/cloud/#amazon-web-services) section under Setup a Cloud Server in User Manual.

### üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

## Version 0.16.0

üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.16.0! This release includes updates with pure market making strategy, more documentation for developers, fix for known Huobi bugs in the previous release, and announcement with our active bounty program.

### üèÜ Harmony Protocol \$ONE Makers program extended

Great news! We're happy to announce that Harmony Protocol has decided to extend the \$ONE Makers program to October and beyond! Users can continue to earn rewards by market making for Harmony's ONE token on any supported exchanges where it trades.

We will keep the rewards schedule the same for October.

### üèÉ Penny jumping mode in **pure_market_making** strategy

After you have placed an order, have you seen other orders respond by making their price slightly better than yours? This is called penny-jumping, and it can be a good way to ensure that your orders have the highest probability of being filled while maximizing the profit upon a fill.

With pure market making strategy (in single order mode), users now have the option to automatically adjust the prices to just above top bid and just below top ask. See [this page](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/advanced-mm/order-optimization/) for more information.

### üíµ Transaction costs in **pure_market_making** strategy

We have conformed how transaction costs are handled across all strategies. By default, the pure market making strategy now incorporates transaction costs like exchange trading fees and gas costs into order prices.

This is a configurable parameter, so users can turn this behavior off if they like. See [this page](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/advanced-mm/add-transaction-costs/).

### üìù More developer documentation

As part of our ongoing efforts to make the Hummingbot code base more understandable and easier to use for developers, we have published guidelines for community-contributed exchange connectors, as well as more documentation on the order lifecycle:

- [Guidelines and expectations for community developers building exchange connectors](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/connectors/order-lifecycle/)
- [Order lifecycle and market events for connectors](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/strategies/#creating-and-cancelling-orders)
- [Changed MarketSymbolPair to MarketTradingPairTuple in strategies for creating and cancelling orders](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/strategies/#creating-and-cancelling-orders)

### üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**

- Custom trading strategy for Market Protocol's LBTC and SBTC via [Gitcoin bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/MARKETProtocol/MARKETProtocol/230/3417)

## Version 0.15.0

üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.15.0! This release is packed full of improvements to various strategies as well as a new major feature: **paper trading mode**.

### üìù Paper trading mode released!

This often asked for, long-awaited feature is now released! Users can now run Hummingbot and simulate trading strategies without executing and placing actual trades.

For more information on how to configure and use this strategy, see [Paper Trading Mode](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/commands/paper-trade/).

### üìä Improvements to the **pure market making** strategy

We have implemented changes to the pure market making strategy improved suggested by an institutional market maker that gives Hummingbot users more control. This allows bots to replenish and place orders once an existing order has been filled:

1. `filled_order_replenish_wait_time`: this new setting allows users to specify a delay in placing a new order once an existing order is filled. The rationale here is to counter momentum and protect against a market that persistenly moves in one direction (for example, mitigates the strategy from continually buying when prices keep trending down).
2. `enable_order_filled_stop_cancellation`: buy and sell orders are typically placed as a pair (1 buy + 1 sell, or multiple pairs in multiple mode). This option allows you to keep one side of the pairing outstanding when the other side is filled, e.g. keep the sell order outstanding when the corresponding buy order is filled. This allows users to crystallize the bid-ask spread in the event that the market moves, if the corresponding sell order is eventually filled. When one side is filled, a new pairing (buy/sell) is created to keep executing the strategy. Note: this may result in an accumulation of outstanding orders, so users are advise to occasionally monitor the strategy and adjust, if necessary.

For more details, read more about the new features [here](/strategies/pure-market-making/#order-adjustment-based-on-filled-events).

### ‚öîÔ∏è Improvements to the **cross exchange market making** strategy

We implemented a number of changes to the cross exchange market making strategy to make the strategy easier to use and for users to understand:

- Use of base asset quantity for order sizing, for consistency with other Hummingbot strategies
- Creation of orders that meet minimum profitability, irrespective of position in the order book (previously, orders deeper in the order book were not being placed)
- Make it easier to reconcile order prices to hedge prices and profitability

### üîç Improvements to the **discovery** strategy

- The UI for the discovery strategy has been updated to make it easier to input single tokens or trading pairs.
- Output is saved into a .csv file.
- Bug fix: discovery strategy errors arising from different token symbol methodologies (capitalization) on different exchanges.

### üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**

- Remove requirements to maintain Ethereum balance to be eligibe to receive bounties
- Fix telegram `history`, which was truncating data: [#743](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/743)

## Version 0.12.1

This release is a hotfix to version [0.12.0](/release-notes/0.12.0).

- Added a fix to correctly track inventory performance when trading two different pairs on the same exchange
- Added a fix to a critical bug in cross exchange market making strategy, where taker orders are being hedged.

## Version 0.12.0

üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.12.0! In this release, we focused on stability, optimization, and addressing numerous reported bugs.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Introducing inventory-based dynamic order sizing

The pure market making strategy now includes a feature that modifies the size of your bid/ask orders in order to maintain a target ratio of base to quote asset. For example, if you are trading ETH-USDT and are targeting a 50%/50% ratio of ETH to USDT, if the value of your ETH holdings accounts for more than 50% of your current portfolio, the bid (buy ETH) size will be reduced while the ask (sell ETH) size will be increased.

Read more about this feature [here](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/advanced-mm/inventory-skew/).

## Version 0.11.0

üöÄWelcome to `hummingbot` version 0.11.0! In this release, we focused on making Hummingbot more accessible for developers and improving the bounty hunter experience. Please see below for what's new in this release.

### üìù Introducing the Developer Manual

We have created a new section in our docs for developers who want to contribute to Hummingbot and extend its capabilities.

Initially, it's focused on helping users understand how Hummingbot strategies work, especially the pure market making strategy.

Over time, we will add more content to the other sections.

### ü§ñ New strategy: `simple_trade`

We added a new strategy: [Simple Trade](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/tutorial/simple-trade/).

This strategy gives users a starter template upon which to customize their own strategies.

### üìü Bounty registration recovery

Liquidity Bounty participants can now use the `bounty --restore-id` command to recover their registration info.

If you accidentally deleted your Docker container and lost your `conf_liquidity_bounty.yml` file, you can now recover it and conttinue to earn rewards.

### üìä CoinGecko data feed integration

Accessing live market prices and other data that may affect trading is an important aspect of running trading bots.

We have integrated the price feed from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en), one of the most comprehensive public crypto data APIs available.

### üêû Other bug fixes and miscellaneous updates

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs! **Note that we pay bug bounties to anyone who reports a bug that we end up fixing.**

- Bots will now respect the minimum order size on IDEX and not try to place orders smaller than minimum order size
- Refactored the strategy classes to move redundant code to the strategy base classes
- Added logic to take into account in-flight orders when determining whether a bot has sufficient balance to place orders
- Fixed bugs related to using the Telegram integration
