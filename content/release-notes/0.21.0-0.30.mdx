## Version 0.30.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.30.0!

### üíµ New command: Balance Limit

As described in feature request [#1443](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1443), users can now apply a limit to the total balance to allocate how much the bot can access in an exchange.

This command is useful when running multiple bots sharing the same assets in an account e.g. setting a 50% USDT limit to each bot running BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT pair.

Run the command `balance limit [exchange] [asset] [amount]` to do this. More information in [balance command](/operation/commands/balance/#balance-limit-exchange-asset-amount).

### üìú New command: Balance Paper

Adding paper trade balances can now be done easier from the Hummingbot client by running `balance paper [asset] [amount]`. Also, users can now check paper trading account balances by running `balance paper` command.

For more information and sample usage, refer to [balance command](/operation/commands/balance/#balance-paper) in our documentation.

### üìñ New command: Order Book

Users can now see the market's order book by running the [order_book](/operation/commands/order_book) command from the Hummingbot CLI while a strategy is running.

By default, this command shows the top 5 bid/ask prices with order volume. It can be used with optional arguments like `--lines` to specify the number of lines to show, `--markets` and `--exchange` if running on cross-exchange and arbitrage strategy.

### üìù Continuously saving trades in CSV file

In the previous versions, users can only see the list of trades in the current session from the `history` command i.e. restarting Hummingbot will start a fresh list of trades in the new session.

Starting this release, all trades are now continuously saved in a CSV file that can be accessed in the `data` folder.

### üóÑ Improved trades list management in database

We changed how Hummingbot manages trades stored in the local database. This allows users to run multiple bots from the same parent directory without mixing up the list of trades in the history output.

This will also allow running multiple windows of Hummingbot via binary without errors when running the `history` command.

### üîß Other Enhancements

- Ethereum node and websocket can now be configured using the `config` command [#2011](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/2011)
- Removed `hang` column from `status` output [#2037](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/2037)

## Version 0.29.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.29.0! In this release, we introduce a new feature that allows users to run custom scripts, new advanced pure market making parameter, a new connector and bug fixes.

### ü§ñ New feature: Scripts

The new Scripts feature allows the user to create mini-Python functions that adjust how Hummingbot behaves. For example, users can automate changes to bot params when certain conditions are met. Read more about the scripts feature in the [Scripts](/advanced/scripts/) section in the documentation.

!!! warning
Currently, Scripts can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker. Using this feature in the Mac or Windows installers will crash the bot.

### üîó New connector: Eterbase

Hummingbot now supports [Eterbase](https://www.eterbase.com/) exchange! Eterbase claims to be the first regulation-compliant European cryptocurrency exchange. Read more about how to use Eterbase connector [here](/connectors/eterbase/).

### üìä New param: Take Crossed Orders

When using an external price source with pure market making, we added the `take_if_crossed` parameter that allows the strategy to fill the matching maker order when it results in a crossed market.

In certain cases, this behavior may be desirable even if the fee is higher because of the likely future price mitigation.

### üêû Other Enhancements and Bug Fixes

- Additional debugging message for websocket connection issues [#1426](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1426) and when orders get stuck in Bittrex [#1340](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1340)

### Enhancements

- Added a [fix (#1868)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1868) for an [enhancement (#1669)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1669) to enter negative values for the `order_level_amount` parameter.
- Added a [fix (#1869)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1869) for an [enhancement (#1752)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1752) to set different bid and ask depth for [order optimization](/strategies/advanced-mm/order-optimization/).

### Bug fixes

- Added a [fix (#1921)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1921) for a Kraken connector [bug (#1901)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1901) that prevented BTC price updates.
- Added a [fix (#1932)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1932) for a configuration [bug (#1895)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1895) that caused a key error in the `celo-arb` strategy when running on Bittrex.
- Added a [fix (#1892)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1892) for a Docker permissions [bug (#1886)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1886) that caused errors when updating to the latest version.

- Added a [fix (#1883)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1883) for a [bug (#1677)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1677) where available balance on Radar Relay was not updating.

## Version 0.28.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.28.0! This release contains the new Celo connector and the new `celo-arb` strategy, new parameters like Ping Pong and Minimum Spread, along with a number of bug fixes and enhancements.

!!! tip "Help shape the direction of the Hummingbot codebase"
In order to communicate the status of bug fixes and planned improvements, we recently began to publish the [Hummingbot Public Roadmap](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/projects/2). Help us prioritize stories by commenting on the ones you want, and feel free to submit new stories.

### üåû New Celo connector and strategy

We are excited to release a Hummingbot connector for Celo blockchain and exchange. Celo is a new Layer 1 protocol that relies upon arbitrageurs to maintain the peg on their cUSD stablecoin. Now, you can run the new `celo-arb` strategy to help stabilize their token price while arbitraging differences between centralized exchanges and the Celo blockchain.

For more information, see the [celo-arb strategy page](/strategies/celo-arb) and the [Celo quickstart guide](/strategies/celo-arb/quickstart).

### üèì New parameter: ping_pong

We introduce a new parameter that allow your bot to alternate placing buy and sell orders, a simple way to keep your inventory levels constant. For more information, please see the [ping pong documentation page](/strategies/advanced-mm/ping-pong).

**We want to thank üôè community member [petrioptrv](https://github.com/petioptrv) for this contribution!**

### üîÑ Redesigned pure market making strategy

We have greatly simplified how the pure market making strategy works in this release, including the sequence of how parameters are applied and fee calculations. This allows external contributors to customize this strategy more easily.

### üì° Removed dependency on external data feeds

Past versions of Hummingbot used the CoinGecko and CoinCap public APIs to fetch asset prices. However, this dependency caused issues for users when those APIs were unavailable. In this release, we have refactored Hummingbot so that the bot uses exchange order books to perform necessary conversions rather than data feeds.

_Note: Assets listed in the `balance` command are now listed in alphabetical order rather than in USD terms._

### ‚òùÔ∏è Trade notifications

When the Hummingbot client makes a trade, it now appends a trade notification message to the lefthand output screen. Users of the [Telegram integration](/advanced/telegram/) should also see these notifications in the Telegram interface.

### üêû Other Enhancements and Fixes

- Added a `minimum_spread` parameter that auto-cancels orders below a certain spread [#1712](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1712)
- Paper trading mode now correctly applies fees charged by the exchange used [#1722](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1722)
- On 0x relayers, Hummingbot now uses `order_refresh_time` to set the order expiration time by default [#1833](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1833)
- Fixed a bug with BTC pairs on Kraken [#1781](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1781)
- Bamboo Relay maintainer [Arctek](https://github.com/Arctek) fixed bugs with Bamboo Relay that prevented it from working [#1800](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1800)
- Fixed a bug with the `history` command on Kraken [#1780](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1780)
- Fixed a bug in which paper trading mode didn't work with the cross-exchange MM strategy [#1672](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1672)

## Version 0.27.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.27.0! This release contains a number of new features for advanced users, along with many core stability improvements and bug fixes to the Hummingbot client.

We're also starting to see more external contributions from the Hummingbot community. See [Community](/community) for more information on how to contribute to Hummingbot.

!!! tip "Introducing the Hummingbot Public Roadmap"
In order to communicate the status of bug fixes and planned improvements, we recently began to publish the [Hummingbot Public Roadmap](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/projects/2). We will keep this page updated, so please bookmark this page to see the newest updates to the Hummingbot codebase.

### üîÑ Order Refresh Tolerance

In [#1673](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1673), we introduce a new parameter in the Pure Market Making (PMM) strategy: `order_tolerance_refresh_pct`. This allows you to set an tolerance level for refreshing orders, so that the bot only cancels and replaces orders if the market price has moved by more than a certain threshold.

This feature should help users create more custom bots and manage exchange rate limits better. See [Order Refresh Tolerance](/strategies/advanced-mm/order-refresh-tolerance/) for more information.

### üìä Price Band

In [#1713](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1713), we introduce two new parameters in the Pure Market Making (PMM) strategy: `price_ceiling` and `price_floor`. These parameters allow you set a price band within which your bot acts normally, but the bot behaves differently if the market price moves out of the band.

This feature should help users express a view that the market will stay range-bound. See [Price Band](/strategies/advanced-mm/price-band/) for more information.

**We want to thank üôè community member [petrioptrv](https://github.com/petioptrv) for this contribution!**

### üêûFixed Memory Leak Bug

We fixed a critical bug [#1683](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1683) that caused the bot to leak memory after users run the `stop` command. This caused the bot to crash unexpectedly after running for a while. This issue is now fixed.

### üêô Kraken Bug Fixes

The Kraken exchange connector, which we released in `v0.26.0`, had a number of bugs. In this release, we have fixed a number of Kraken related bugs, including [#1664](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1664), [#1671](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1671), [#1676](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1676), [#1696](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1696), and [#1693](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1693).

This connector should be much more stable going forward.

### ‚è± LIMIT_MAKER order type in Binance

To fix [#1633](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1633), we now use the `LIMIT_MAKER` order type by default for maker orders on Binance. This order type prevents your bot from making crossed orders that would be taken automatically. This feature should help users set tight spreads more effectively.

### üêû External DB Support

After [#1596](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1596), you can hook up the Hummingbot client to external SQL databases. See [External Database](/advanced/db-config/) for more information.

**We want to thank üôè community member [fengkiej](https://github.com/fengkiej) for this contribution!**

### üêû Other Enhancements and Fixes

- Fixed a bug in which buy and sell order refreshes could sometimes get out of sync [#1446](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1446)
- Fixed a bug that prevented the XEMM strategy from starting [#1657](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1657)

- Fixed a bug with the Inventory Skew feature where orders sometimes alternate every cycle [#1747](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1747)
- Fixed a bug missing spreads in `status` in the XEMM strategy [#1737](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1737)
- Fixed a bug where the version number was missing from the splash screen [#1739](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1739)
- Fixed a bug in the Bittrex connector related to minimum order amount [#1636](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1636)
- Fixed a bug where the version number was missing from the splash screen [#1739](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1739)
- Removed deprecated deposit and withdrawal functions from the Binance connector [#1731](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1731)
- Removed incorrect trading pair fetcher code from the Bittrex connector [#1700](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1700). **We want to thank üôè community member [aktary](https://github.com/aktary) for this contribution!**
- Fixed bugs related to input validation of the `import` command [#1704](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1704)
- Fixed a bug with incorrect display of bot duration in `history` command [#1686](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1686)

## Version 0.26.1

This release is a hotfix to version [0.26.0](/release-notes/0.26.0).

- Added a [fix (#1732)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1732) in configuration module to address a [bug (#1731)](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1731) that caused bot to spam trading error.

## Version 0.26.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.26.0! This release contains a lot of changes in the Hummingbot client, aimed at improving the user experience for new and existing users alike.

!!! note "Old config files won't work"
This release contains many changes to the import process, so previous strategy configuration files will not be compatible with this version.

### üîê New password screen

![](/assets/img/welcome.gif)

Now, you are asked to enter your password when you start the Hummingbot client.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Revamped commands

We have extensively revamped the commands in Hummingbot. New commands include:

- `connect`: displays a list of available exchanges and helps you connect to them
- `balance`: see your asset balances across all exchanges
- `create`: create a bot
- `import`: import an existing bot configurationn

See the [Command Reference](/operation/commands) for all commands.

### üç± Standardized parameter names and spread/percent inputs

We have changed parameter names in the Pure Market Making strategy to make them clearer. For example, the frequency used to cancel and refresh orders is now `order_refresh_time` (old name: `cancel_order_wait_time`). Here are all the new [Basic](/strategies/pure-market-making/#basic-configuration-parameters-and-walkthrough) and [Advanced](/strategies/advanced-mm/#advanced-configuration-parameters) parameters.

In addition, we have standardized all **spread** and **percent** inputs, so that users enter percentage values. For example, to set a 1% `bid_spread`, enter `1` instead of `0.01`. To set a 5% `kill_switch_pct`, enter `5` instead of `0.05`.

Any parameter names that ends with `-pct` or `-spread` use this format.

#### üí∏ Change spreads on the fly

An often-requested feature is the ability to adjust the bot without stopping it. We have started to make more parameters adjustable on the fly, starting with spreads.

Now you can use the revamped [config](/operation/commands/config) command to adjust spreads without stopping the bot. We plan to extend this functionality to other parameters such as order amount in the future.

### üîó New Kraken connector

Hummingbot now supports [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange! Kraken is a centralized exchange where users can trade not only several cryptocurrencies but as well as various fiat currencies such as USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, CHF and JPY.

Read more about how to use Kraken connector [here](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/kraken/).

### üì± Improved Telegram integration

The Telegram integration now has a smaller keyboard that doesn't block the main view. Displayed messages are now in HTML instead of Markdown to improve readability.

### üêû Bug fixes

- Added Microsoft Visual C++ redist package as part of the setup process to fix binary installer for Windows: [#1598](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1598)
- Fixed broken trading pair fetcher in Radar Relay: [#1441](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1441)
- Fixed Bittrex connector failing to initialize markets: [#1534](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1534)
- Fixed incorrect price precision on some BTC pairs in Binance while paper trading that results to bad orders: [#1618](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1618), [#1617](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1617)
- Fixed error invalid value `[]` when using discovery strategy: [#1587](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1587)
- Fixed how `history` shows prices of executed trades in Liquid connector: [#1415](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1415), [#1589](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1589)

### üöÄ Coming soon

Here's what we currently working on that we expect to ship in the 1-2 releases:

- Improved order refresh logic to avoid hitting exchange rate limits when placing many orders
- [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) connector (in progress [#1482](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1482))

## Version 0.25.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.25.0! In this release, we continued working on the stability of Liquidity Mining backend, scaling/optimizing the infrastructure for quicker updates and incrased capacity. There are also major improvements in pure market making strategy including inventory skew, status outputs, hanging order mode, and filled order delays.

### üö∞ Updated dependencies to improve stability

In order to address memory leaks that cause the bot to crash, we upgraded Python to version 3.8 as well as `prompt-toolkit`, the client interface framework. These fixes should greatly improve bot stability and reduce crashes due to memory leaks.

In addition, we advise users to not `stop` and `start` the bot frequently before running it long-term. This appears to elevate memory usage and cause the bot to crash more frequently. We continue to monitor this issue.

!!! tip "Updating from source"
Due to the updated Python version, users who install Hummingbot from source need to run `./uninstall` and `./clean` before updating.

### üí• New `status` command

We made some changes to how bot `status` is displayed to make it more informative for users.

![](/assets/img/inventory-skew-2.png)

- Added a new section if **Inventory Skew** is enabled
- Added **Spread** to show the order's spread from the mid price
- Added **Age** column to show how long orders are outstanding from the time when created
- Added **Hang** column to indicate if the active order is a hanging order
- Shows the current **Mid price**

### üìä New Advanced Market Marketing section

Due to the extreme market volatility in the last 2 weeks, many users have reporting losing money due to market swings. In this release, we have made major improvements to advanced market making features. We believe that these features will enable users to configure their bots so that they respond better to market volatility.

See the new [Advanced Market Marketing](/strategies/advanced-mm) section to learn more about how these features work. We have described the main changes below.

#### Inventory skew

We changed the inventory skew algorithm to a better behaved one to limit the user's trading exposure within a defined range. This prevents users from being over-exposed from the risks of a single side of the trade when the market keeps hitting limit orders on one side only.

More information can be found in our documentation for [Inventory Skew](/strategies/advanced-mm/inventory-skew) with sample scenarios.

#### Hanging orders

Hanging orders are now tracked as active orders when sending the `status` command. These orders will get cancelled after sending the `stop` or `exit` command. Also, users can now specify through `cancel_hanging_order_pct` to cancel hanging orders when their spreads are above a certain value.

Read through [Hanging Orders](/strategies/advanced-mm/hanging-orders) in our documentation for more information.

#### Safer defaults

In addition to these advanced features, we also changed the default values of the following parameters to make them safer for new users:

- `cancel_order_wait_time`: now **30** seconds (previously 60 seconds)
- `filled_order_replenish_wait_time`: now **60** seconds (previously 10 seconds)

### üêû Other bug fixes

- Fixed Hummingbot resetting to a command line screen when errors are shown: [#1519](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/1519)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous updates

- Hummingbot Miner now supports Ledger Nano X as as well as mobile wallets such as Metamask Mobile, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.
- Minimum order amount validation now applies to `order_start_size` prompt in multiple order mode
- `start` command no longer cancels and replaces orders if the strategy is already running

### üöÄ Coming soon

Here's what we currently working on that we expect to ship in the next 2-8 weeks:

**Hummingbot Miner**

- Leaderboard: weekly rankings of top miners
- Snapshot view: detailed breakdown of reward allocation in an individual snapshot
- Market view: details about a specific trading pair

**Hummingbot client**

- [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) connector (in progress [#1482](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1482))
- [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) connector (in progress [#1454](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1454))
- [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/) connector (in progress [#1224](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/pull/1224))

## Version 0.24.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.24.0! In this release, we continuously worked on backend to improve Liquidity Mining in preparation for the upcoming launch, modified order amount to improve first time user experience, and addressed a couple of bugs in the Binance connector.

### üåä‚õè Liquidity mining going live on March 3rd

We will be launching Liquidity Mining officially on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020 12:00 AM UTC! We welcome anyone who‚Äôs interested to earn token rewards on the [Hummingbot Miners App](https://miners.hummingbot.io).

Please refer to the following links and resources for more information:

- [Liquidity Mining FAQs](https://docs.hummingbot.io/faq/liquidity-mining/)
- [Liquidity Mining Policy](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-mining-policy/)

### üìä Minimum order amount

The `order_amount` parameter in pure market making and cross-exchange strategy now displays during prompt a default minimum value. This allows users to prevent entering a value below the exchange‚Äôs minimum order size resulting in no orders being created. Advanced users who want more flexibility can change or zero out the minimums in the global config file.

- Reworked Liquidity Mining section\* Improved quickstart guide for Windows, macOS and Linux

### üìä Pure market making configuration simplified

Pure market making now has a basic/advanced split that will only prompt during configuration of the basic parameters such as the exchange name, trading pair, bid/ask spreads, cancel order wait time, and order amount.

Users can configure the advanced features of this strategy by entering `Yes` when prompted, via `config <parameter>` command in Hummingbot, or by editing the strategy config file.

More information about [Basic Mode](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/#basic-mode) and [Advanced Mode](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/#advanced-mode) of Pure Market Making in our User Manual.

### üîó New KuCoin connector

Hummingbot now supports [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) exchange! Nicknamed the "People's Exchange"‚Äã, Kucoin is easy to use for novice investors and in-depth enough for crypto enthusiasts. It has one of the world‚Äôs most impressive trading pair selections, a wide range of alt coins with more than 300 trading pairs and are adding new ones regularly.

Read more about how to use KuCoin connector in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/kucoin/).

### üìú Error log collection

Instead of using the old `hummingbot_logs.yml` templates for sending logs, we now added a prompt in Hummingbot that allows users to enable or disabled sending errors logs.

Read through [Logs and Logging](https://docs.hummingbot.io/advanced/logging/#error-log-collection) section of our Utilities page for more information.

### ü§ì Developer documentation

We created a guide that walks you through how to prepare your development environment and get started developing for Hummingbot using Linux, macOS and Windows.

Read through our [Developer Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/gettingstarted) for more information.

## Version 0.22.0
