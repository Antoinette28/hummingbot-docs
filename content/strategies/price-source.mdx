**Updated as of `v0.29.0`**

By default, Hummingbot uses the order book you're trading in to generate the **mid price** (between the top bid and the top ask) as a starting price to calculate maker order prices.

With this feature, you can now use a different order book for the starting mid price, such as an external **exchange** or a **custom API**.

## `price_source_enabled`

When enabled, allows users to use an external pricing source for the mid price.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">
    Would you like to use an external pricing source for mid-market price?
    (Yes/No)
  </font>
</div>

## `price_source_type`

The type of external pricing source.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">
    Which type of external price source to use? (exchange/custom_api)
  </font>
</div>

## `price_source_exchange`

Name of exchange to be used for external pricing source.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">Enter external price source exchange name</font>
</div>

## `price_source_market`

The trading pair for the price source exchange.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">Enter the token pair on [price_source_exchange]</font>
</div>

## `price_source_custom`

An external API that returns price.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">Enter pricing API URL</font>
</div>

## `take_if_crossed`

Take order if they cross orderbook when external price source is enabled.

** Prompt: **

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
  <font color="#20a26a">
    Do you want to let your maker orders match and fill if they cross the order
    book?
  </font>
</div>

## How It Works

In a situation where the calculation of maker order prices from external sources would result in the order matching any existing orders on the order book, such order will be ignored.

Type `config price_source_enabled` to start the configuration process.

First, set `price_source_type`: choose whether you want to use another exchange (`exchange`) or a custom API (`custom`). Based on your answer, you can set the exchange order book or enter an API endpoint.

> **Note:** Currently, the external price source cannot be the same as the maker exchange (i.e. if the bot is trading on Binance, the `price_source_exchange` cannot be Binance).

## When to use an external price source

External price source is valuable when your bot is market making for a relatively illiquid trading pair, but a more liquid pair with the same underlying exposure is available on a different exchange.

Suppose we are market making for the `ETH-USDT` trading pair. The exchange we are trading on, denoted as **Exchange A**, has the top bid order at $198 and the top ask order at $202, so the mid price is \$200.

Let's suppose there is **Exchange B** with an `ETH-USD` trading pair. That pair has a top bid order at $200 while the top ask order is $202, so the mid price is \$201. These discrepancies often happens between different exchanges as market conditions change. Some exchanges may react more slowly or quickly to market changes due to differences in the trading pair, liquidity, geography.

If you believe that `ETH-USD` on Exchange B is more liquid and responds more quickly to market information than `ETH-USDT` on Exchange A, you may want to market make on Exchange A but use `ETH-USD` on Exchange B as the price source. This helps you position your orders based on where the market might go in the future.

## Taking Crossed Orders

When using an external price source, an order may result in a crossed market. This means the order on the current exchange is placed with a price that matches an existing order in the book. Enabling `take_if_crossed` parameter allows the strategy to fill the matching maker order.

In certain cases, this behavior may be desirable even if the fee is higher because of the likely future price mitigation. This feature is only available when an external price source is used. When enabled, Hummingbot uses `LIMIT` order instead of `LIMIT_MAKER` order type.
