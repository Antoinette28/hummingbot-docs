The current release of Hummingbot comes with 4 strategies:

### Pure Market Making

Post buy and sell offers for an instrument on a single exchange, automatically adjust prices while actively managing inventory.

For experienced users of this strategy, see [Advanced Market Making](./advanced-mm) for how to use more sophisticated features of this strategy.

### Cross Exchange Market Making

Also referred to as _liquidity mirroring_ or _exchange remarketing_. In this strategy, Hummingbot makes markets (creates buy and sell orders) on smaller or less liquid exchanges and does the opposite, back-to-back transaction for any filled trades on a more liquid exchange.

### Arbitrage

Aims to capture price differentials between two different exchanges (buy low on one, sell high on the other).

The [Hummingbot whitepaper](https://www.hummingbot.io/hummingbot.pdf) provides more details about these strategies, as well as additional ones that we are working on for future versions of Hummingbot.

### Celo Arbitrage

The celo-arb strategy is a special case of the normal arbitrage strategy that arbitrages between the automated market maker (AMM) exchange on the Celo blockchain and other markets supported by Hummingbot. This strategy allows users to earn arbitrage profits while contributing to the stability of the Celo cUSD price peg.
