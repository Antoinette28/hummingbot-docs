## Connectors

This section contains information about official connectors for individual exchanges and protocols, including:

* General information
* Setup and configuration
* Minimum order sizes, fees, etc.

### What are Connectors?

Connectors are packages of code that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different cryptocurrency exchanges. 
They interact with a given exchange's API, such as by gathering order book data and sending and cancelling trades. 
See following for the list of exchanges which Hummingbot currently has connectors to.


## Binance 

Binance is a global cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading more than 100 cryptocurrencies. It is considered one of the top cryptocurrency trading platforms by volume. It also serves as a wallet for users who hold accounts on the exchange.

### Using the Connector

Because Binance is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Binance API key >>>
Enter your Binance secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

> Tip "Copying and pasting into Hummingbot: See [this page](/faq/troubleshooting/#paste-items-from-clipboard-in-putty) for more instructions in our Support section.

#### Creating Binance API Keys

1 - Log into your account at https://www.binance.com, then select **Account** (If you do not have an account, you will have to create one and verify your ID).

> Tip "Important tip": You must enable 2FA in your Binance account to create the API key. [How to enable 2FA?](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000011592-Two-Factor-Authentication)

2 - Click on **API Setting**.
![binance1](binance1.png)

3 - Enter a key name and click on **Create New Key**.

![binance2](binance2.png)

4 - Enter your 2FA code. Once you pass the authentication, Binance will send a confirmation mail to your registered email inbox. Please click “Confirm Create” to make the confirmation for the new API creation.

![binance3](binance3.png)

5 - Now you have created an API key. Please note that to trade on Binance using Hummingbot, **Enable Trading** must be selected.

> Warning "API key permissions": We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent is unnecessary** for current Hummingbot strategies.

![binance4](binance4.png)

Make sure you store your Secret Key somewhere secure, and do not share it with anyone. Your Secret Key will only be displayed once at the time when you create the API.

> warning: If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API.

### Miscellaneous Info

#### Minimum Order Sizes

See [this page](https://www.binance.com/en/trade-rule) for the minimum order size per trading pair. Typically, the minimum is around $10 equivalent of whichever currency you are trading in.

#### Transaction Fees

By default, trading fees are 0.1% on Binance for both market makers and takers. However, users who trade high volumes and own substantial amounts of Binance Coin can receive discounts. More details can be found [here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/115000429332-Fee-Structure-on-Binance). 

Users can override the default fees by editing [`conf_fee_overrides.yml`](/advanced/fee-overrides/).

#### Sub-Accounts

You can use an API key from a [Binance sub-account](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/binance-introduces-sub-account-support-d7bf2f95e28c) just like you do for a normal Binance account. Please ensure that you use the **sub-account API key** and not the master account API key.

If you are participating in [Liquidity Mining](/liquidity-mining), please also use the **sub-account read-only API key** when you sign up.

### Asset Codes

Kraken uses asset codes in front of some pairs as a classification system. Asset codes starting with **'X'** represent cryptocurrencies, though this is no longer followed for the newest coins. Asset codes starting with **'Z'** represent fiat currencies. 

BTC is represented as XBT in this exchange. Therefore trading on this pair is viewed as XXBT e.g. XXBT-USDT. However Hummingbot uses symbol conversion so it will be entered as `BTC-USDT`. For e.g.
![](/kraken_sample.png)

[Radar Relay](https://radarrelay.com/) is an exchange application specializing in ERC-20 tokens that uses the [0x Protocol](https://0x.org/). Founded in 2017, it is a newer exchange that has rapidly gained users and features continuous trading with its off-chain order book.

### Using the Connector

Because Radar Relay is a decentralized exchange, you will need an independent cryptocurrency wallet and an ethereum node in order to use Hummingbot. See below for information on how to create these:

### Miscellaneous Info

#### Minimum Order Size

Each trading pair has a unique minimum order size denominated in the *base currency*.  You can access the minimum order size for a specific token pair using [Radar Relay's API](https://developers.radarrelay.com/api/feed-api/markets), at the following URL:

```
https://api.radarrelay.com/v3/markets/{marketId}
```

For example, for `ZRX-WETH`, navigate to: [https://api.radarrelay.com/v3/markets/**`ZRX-WETH`**](https://api.radarrelay.com/v3/markets/ZRX-WETH).

Sample output:

```
{
  "id": "ZRX-WETH",
  "displayName": "ZRX/WETH",
  "baseTokenAddress": "0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498",
  "quoteTokenAddress": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
  "baseTokenDecimals": 18,
  "quoteTokenDecimals": 18,
  "quoteIncrement": 8,
  "minOrderSize": "0.04568281", <== ** MINIMUM ORDER SIZE **
  "maxOrderSize": "1000000000",
  "score": 66.7,
  "active": 1
}
```

In this example, the minimum order size is 0.04568281 ZRX.

For additional information, see [this page](https://support.radarrelay.com/en/support/solutions/articles/42000022036-do-you-have-a-minimum-or-maximum-order-size-). For the most part, the smallest order size allowed is about the equivalent of $1.

#### Transaction Fees

Presently, Radar Relay does [not charge](https://support.radarrelay.com/en/support/solutions/articles/42000022033-what-are-your-fees-) trading or withdrawal fees, and the only additional cost for transactions is the gas network costs. This may change in the future as the exchange develops a larger user base.
