## Bamboo Relay Connector

[Bamboo Relay](https://bamboorelay.com/) is an exchange application specializing in ERC-20 tokens that uses the [0x Protocol](https://0x.org/).
Currently, Bamboo Relay allows any user to connect their wallet and trade between any coin pair combination.

### Using the Connector

Because Bamboo Relay is a decentralized exchange, you will need an independent cryptocurrency wallet and an ethereum node in order to use Hummingbot. See below for information on how to create these:

- [Creating a crypto wallet](/advanced/wallet)
- [Creating an ethereum node](/advanced/node)

### Connector Operating Modes

The Bamboo Relay connector supports two modes of operation, [open order book](https://0x.org/wiki#Open-Orderbook) and [coordinated order book](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v2/coordinator-specification.md).

By default the open order book mode is on for maximum order visibility and network syndication.

#### Open Order Book

Open order book mode allows for off-chain orders to be submitted and any taker to fill these orders on-chain.
Orders may only be cancelled by submitting a transaction and paying gas network costs.

Open orders are syndicated through the [0x Mesh Network](https://0x-org.gitbook.io/mesh/) as well as directly submitted to the [0x API](https://0x.org/docs/api).

#### Coordinated order book

The coordinated order book mode extends the open order book mode by adding the ability to soft-cancel orders and a selective delay on order fills, while preserving network and contract fillable liquidity.
This is achieved by the use of a coordinator server component and coordinator smart contracts.

At this time coordinated orders are not supported through the [0x Mesh Network](https://0x-org.gitbook.io/mesh/) or [0x API](https://0x.org/docs/api).

To enable coordinator mode set the `bamboo_relay_use_coordinator` parameter to `true` in `conf_global.yml` in the `/conf` directory.

### Pre-emptive Cancels

The Bamboo Relay front-end UI does not show orders that have less than 30 seconds expiry remaining. This is so that users should only attempt to fill orders that have a reasonable chance of succeeding.

When running the connector in coordinated mode it is advised to enable this setting so that orders are automatically refreshed when they have 30 seconds remaining.

### Daily Server Restarts

Bamboo Relay's server restarts at least twice a day which will drop WebSocket connections. As a result, errors will show up in the logs a few times in a day transiently before Hummingbot just reconnects.

Specifically it is Nginx that restarts that takes ~1 second when it happens. If it ends up being minutes, then there may be a problem. If it's just for a few seconds then it's almost 100% the restarts.

```

### Miscellaneous Info

#### Minimum Order Sizes

The minimum acceptable order size is 0.004 WETH for pairs traded against WETH, this is to prevent transactional costs being higher than the nominal order amount.

#### Transaction Fees

Currently Bamboo Relay does not charge trading or withdrawal fees. This is set to change February 1st, 2020 with the introduction of relayer fees. See the [fee schedule](https://bamboorelay.com/fees) for the latest information.

0x Protocol V3 levies an additional protocol fee for each order filled, this is calculated as 150,000 \* gasPrice per order.
This is in addition to the standard Ethereum transaction fees.

## Dolomite Connector

[Dolomite](https://beta.dolomite.io/exchange) is a decentralized exchange powered by the Loopring Protocol that allows you to trade dozens of ERC20 token assets securely, right from your own wallet.

### Using the Connector

Dolomite streamlines the decentralized exchange experience so that users can utilize the security and control of a DEX while enjoying the user interface simplicity of a centralized exchange.

An ethereum node is required in order to use Hummingbot with Dolomite. Luckily, an Ethereum node is only needed for approving tokens, which is a one-time process. So, users of the Dolomite connector can rest assured it will add virtually no extra stress to their node. See below for information on how to create an Ethereum node and wallet:

- [Creating a crypto wallet](/advanced/wallet)
- [Creating an ethereum node](/advanced/node)

In addition to the above, the user must also create an account on Dolomite. As of now, this takes 1 of 2 forms:

1. For users **inside** the US, they must create an account from the site [https://app.dolomite.io](https://app.dolomite.io).
2. For users **outside** the US, they simply must submit a trade. When Dolomite sees the first trade from a new wallet, it automatically creates an account for it.

**Note**: The above 2 criteria hold true for where _Hummingbot_ is running. For example, if you live _outside_ the US, but you are running Hummingbot from within the US in the cloud (IE AWS or Azure), you still must create an account. Please reach out to us if you face any problems doing so!

For users who have little to no prior experience using a decentralized exchange, Dolomite also has a simple account system that does not require users to setup and manage their own private keys. Read more through here in [Dolomite Traditional Accounts](https://dolomite.io/support/noncustodial-accounts).

### Miscellaneous Info

#### Minimum Order Size

The current minimum order size is $10 for takers and $40 for makers.

#### Transaction Fees

Dolomite has a competitive fee structure, charging 0.5% for takers and -0.1% for makers. It is the first decentralized exchange to introduce negative maker fees. Every trade that a maker places into the exchange that gets filled receives -0.1% of the value of the trade (e.g. if your maker order of $1,000 gets filled you receive a rebate of $1 in real-time).

There are no transaction fees required in order to place or cancel trades.

Some additional small flat fees may be applied to your trades. More information can be found in [this page](https://dolomite.io/support/fees).
