title: "Pause and Resume"

This feature allows users to pause a running strategy using the command `exit --suspend`. This allows the bot to stop while keeping the hanging orders in the order book. To resume, run the command `start --restore`.

## Pause

The `exit --suspend` command will exit the hummingbot client but leave the orders hanging and hanging orders will remain as hanging orders.

This could be an advantage if you don’t want to cancel orders but want to exit the bot.
