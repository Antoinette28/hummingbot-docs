title: "Pause and Resume"
---

This feature allows users to pause a running strategy using the command `exit --suspend`. This allows the bot to stop while keeping the hanging orders in the order book. To resume, run the command `start --restore`.

## Pause

The `exit --suspend` command will exit the hummingbot client but leave the orders hanging and hanging orders will remain as hanging orders.

This could be an advantage if you donâ€™t want to cancel orders but want to exit the bot.

## Resume

The `start --restore` command will start the strategy `config` and restore the last sets of orders and hanging orders as well.

> Note: After running `start --restore` spreads may change once the bot brings back your orders, it will display what the current spreads of your order.

You can see that when we use `exit --suspend` it exits the bot. When you run `start --resume` the hanging orders remained as hanging and the order that was not filled became a hanging order. Refer to the example below
