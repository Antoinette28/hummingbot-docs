title: "Pause and Resume"
---

This feature allows users to pause a running strategy using the command `exit --suspend`. This allows the bot to stop while keeping the hanging orders in the order book. To resume, run the command `start --restore`.

## Pause

The `exit --suspend` command will "pause" the strategy and exit the hummingbot client. All active orders will become hanging orders while hanging orders will stay hanging when resumed at a later time.

This could be an advantage if you donâ€™t want to cancel orders but want to exit the bot.

## Resume

To resume a "paused" strategy, import the config file and run the command s`tart --restore`. It will create new sets of active orders on top of the hanging orders from when it was paused.

> Note: After running `start --restore` spreads may change once the bot brings back your orders, it will display what the current spreads of your order.

You can see that when we use `exit --suspend` it exits the bot. When you run `start --restore` all active orders became hanging orders. Refer to the example below.

## Important Notes

Always use `start --restore` when resuming a paused strategy. Accidentally running the `start` command after importing the config file will cancel all of its dangling orders and start the strategy from a fresh state.
