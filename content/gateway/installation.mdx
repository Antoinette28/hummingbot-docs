This page describes the installation process for Gateway.

## Create SSL Certificates

1. Run the command `generate_certs` in the Hummingbot client
2. Enter a passphrase to be used later during installation

> **NOTE:** It is recommended not to use the same password as the Hummingbot instance.

## Install Gateway via Docker

1. Take note of the absolute path where your Hummingbot files are stored. You can run the command `pwd` from the terminal while inside the folder.
2. Copy and paste the following commands to your terminal:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```Mac
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create-gateway.sh -o create-gateway.sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/update-gateway.sh -o update-gateway.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
./create-gateway.sh
```

```Linux
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create-gateway.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/update-gateway.sh
chmod a+x *.sh
./create-gateway.sh
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

It downloads the scripts from GitHub, sets their correct permission and runs the `create-gateway` script.

3. Answer each prompt, review the summary and enter **Y** to proceed with the installation.

> **NOTE:** When creating a Gateway instance for Ethereum protocol connectors such as [Balancer](/protocol-connectors/balancer) and [Uniswap](/protocol-connectors/uniswap), the script picks up the settings from your global config file (`conf_global.yml`). Make sure to connect them first from the Hummingbot client before installing Gateway.

By default, Gateway will install on port `5000` which Hummingbot will connect to. If the default port is not available, Gateway will find the next port number.

4. The file `gateway.env` is created where your Gateway settings are saved.

## Configure Port Number (Optional)

In case the port number used by Gateway is not set to the default value of `5000`, make sure to set the `gateway_api_port` in the Hummingbot client to match the same port number.

1. Run command `config gateway_api_port` in the Hummingbot client
3. Enter the port number indicated when Gateway was created

**(Optional Settings 2) Using Defipulse**

If you want to use and configure defipulse as the gas estimator

1. Access Hummingbot.
2. Enter `config ethgasstation_gas_enabled`, and enter `True`
3. Enter `config ethgasstation_api_key`, and enter the Defipulse API key.
4. Enter `config ethgasstation_gas_level`, and the following prompt is displayed. 

> **Note:** For caculation details on the various gas level, see [defipulse docs](https://docs.defipulse.com/api-docs-by-provider/egs/gas-price)

<div style={{ padding: "10px 20px", backgroundColor: "#1c1c1c" }}>
     <font color="#20a26a">
       Enter gas level you want to use for Ethererum transcations (fast,
       fastest, safeLow, average) >>>
     </font>
   </div><br/>

5. Enter the value for the gas level.
6. (Optional) Enter `config ethgasstation_refresh_time`, enter a value to overwrite the default Gas Station refresh time (120secs).

## Update Gateway via Docker

To update the docker container, run the `update-gateway.sh` script and and follow the prompt instructions. The update script allows you to stop and delete the running instance, and update the docker image if it is not the latest. Upon completion, it will automatically execute the create-gateway.sh script to create a new Gateway container instance.
