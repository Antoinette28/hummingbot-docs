title: Balancer
---

Balancer is an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor, in other words, a decentralized finance protocol based on Ethereum that allows automatic market making.

## Inventory

- Similar to the arbitrage strategy, you will need to hold inventory of trading pairs in Ethereum wallet and on a secondary exchange, in order to be able to trade and capture price differentials
- You also need some Gas in order to pay for transaction fees on the submit transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Connecting to Balancer

As Balancer is not a typical centralized exchange but a Ethereum-based automated market maker protocol, you need to install a gateway to connect. See [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arb/) for details.
