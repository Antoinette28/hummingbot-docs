The Windows setup package is the easiest way for Windows users to setup and run Hummingbot. Windows setup packages are released with every Hummingbot release starting from v0.18.

### Installing Hummingbot with Windows Setup Package

1. Download Setup.exe from our [download page](https://hummingbot.io/download).
2. Double-click `Setup.exe` hummingbot binary package to launch the installer.

3. Start Hummingbot in your Windows start menu.

### Application Data Files

The application data files (e.g. logs and config files) are located differently for binary package installed Hummingbot vs. source compiled Hummingbot.

For the Windows binary distribution, the application data files are located in `%localappdata%\hummingbot.io\Hummingbot`.

## Install via Docker

The Hummingbot code base is designed and optimized for UNIX-based systems such as macOS and Linux. We recommend that Windows users either:

- Install in [the cloud](/installation/cloud) and use a native Linux virtual machine.
- Install using Docker version: [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) recommended.

Hummingbot can also be installed by utilizing the built-in Windows Subsystem for Linux. However, this is only recommended for users familiar with development.

**Note:** For Windows users without Windows-Pro or Windows-Enterprise, you will need to install the Docker Toolbox, as Windows-Home is not supported by the standard Docker application. Below, we list instructions for running Hummingbot using the Docker Toolbox.

1. Install Docker Toolbox

Download the latest version Docker Toolbox .exe file at the following link: [Docker Toolbox Releases](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/).

2. Locate the installer in the downloads folder and run a full installation with included VirtualBox and Git for Windows. (Git is the default shell used by Docker)

![Docker Installation](docker_toolbox_install.PNG)

By default, a shortcut to the Docker Quickstart terminal will be created on your desktop. You can open Docker Toolbox using this shortcut.

3. Run Hummingbot

Open Docker Toolbox using the Quickstart shortcut. Move onto the next step when you reach the following screen.

Enter the following commands into the command line. You can install Hummingbot by selecting **_either_** of the following options from the tabs below:

- **Scripts**: download and use automated install scripts.
- **Manual**: run install commands manually.

```Scripts
# 1) Navigate to root folder
cd ~

# 2) Download Hummingbot install, start, and update script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/create.sh -o create.sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/start.sh -o start.sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/development/installation/docker-commands/update.sh -o update.sh

# 3) Enable script permissions
chmod a+x *.sh

# 4) Create a hummingbot instance
./create.sh
```

```Manual
# 1) Navigate to root folder
cd ~

# 2) Create folder for your new instance
mkdir hummingbot_files

# 2) Create folders for logs, config files and database file
mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf
mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs
mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_data
mkdir hummingbot_files/hummingbot_scripts

# 3) Launch a new instance of hummingbot
docker run -it \
--network host \
--name hummingbot-instance \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf,destination=/conf/" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs,destination=/logs/" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_data,destination=/data/" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_scripts,destination=/scripts/" \

## Install from Source

This section walks you through how to prepare your development environment and install Hummingbot from source manually.

The Hummingbot code base is designed and optimized for UNIX-based systems such as macOS and Linux. We recommend that Windows users:

- Install in [the cloud](/installation/cloud) by using a native Linux virtual machine.

Hummingbot can also be installed by utilizing the built-in Windows Subsystem for Linux. However, this is only recommended for users familiar with development.

The following instructions are summarized for installing Hummingbot from source on Windows 10, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Install Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux

Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for installing Windows Subsystem for Linux, and then Ubuntu.

2. Install Hummingbot on Linux Subsystem

![Bash for Windows](bash-for-windows.png)

You can install Hummingbot as shown below:

```
# 1) Navigate to root folder
cd ~

# 2) Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

# 3) Install Miniconda3
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# 4) Log out and log back into shell to register "conda" command
exit

# 5) Log back into or open a new Linux terminal

# 6) Clone Hummingbot
git clone https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot.git

# 7) Install Hummingbot
cd hummingbot && ./install

# 8) Activate environment and compile code
conda activate hummingbot && ./compile

# 9) Start Hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```
