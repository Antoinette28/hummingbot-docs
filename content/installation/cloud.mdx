Using Hummingbot as a long running service can be achieved with the help of cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. You may read our blog about running [Hummingbot on different cloud providers](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-06-cloud-providers/).

As of **version 0.28.0** installing Docker takes up around 500 MB of storage space and 4 GB for Hummingbot Docker image. We tested to install and run Hummingbot on these free to lowest machine types.

| Provider              | Instance Type   | Instance Details      |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Google Cloud Platform | g1-small        | 1 vCPU, 1.7 GB memory |
| Amazon Web Services   | t2.micro        | 1 vCPU, 1 GB memory   |
| Microsoft Azure       | Standard_D2s_v3 | 2 vCPU, 8 GB memory   |

These instances are pre-loaded with system files that takes up around 1.2 GB so we recommend having at least **8 GB of storage space** in your cloud server.

> note "Exception for celo-arb strategy": Running a [Celo Arbitrage](/strategies/celo-arb/) strategy requires a minimum of `t2.medium` AWS instance type for improved performance.

The following instructions shows you how to set up a new Virtual Machine Instance on each major cloud platform.

## Google Cloud Platform

1. Log in to your Google account at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. From the navigation menu, go to **Computer Engine** then **VM instances**
