## macOS

**Prerequisites**

This section walks you through how to prepare your development environment.

1. Install Xcode command line tools

Running Hummingbot on **macOS** requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and Xcode command line tools.

```
xcode-select --install
```

2. Install Anaconda3

Hummingbot requires Python 3 and other Python libraries. To manage these dependencies, Hummingbot uses Anaconda, an open source environment and package manager for Python that is the current industry standard for data scientists and data engineers.

To install Anaconda, go to [the Anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and download the **Python 3.7 installer** for your operating system. Both the graphical installer and the command line installer will work. Run the installer, and it will guide you through the installation process.

Afterwards, open a Terminal window and try the `conda` command. If the command is valid, then Anaconda has been successfully installed, even if the graphical installer says that it failed.

> Warning: If you use ZSH or another Unix shell, copy the code snippet below to your `.zshrc` or similar file. By default, Anaconda only adds it to your `.bash_profile` file. This makes the `conda` command available in your root path.

```
__conda_setup="$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    \eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base
    else
        \export PATH="/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
```

## Windows

This section walks you through how to prepare your development environment and install Hummingbot from source manually.

The Hummingbot code base is designed and optimized for UNIX-based systems such as macOS and Linux. We recommend that Windows users:

- Install in [the cloud](/installation/cloud) by using a native Linux virtual machine.

Hummingbot can also be installed by utilizing the built-in Windows Subsystem for Linux. However, this is only recommended for users familiar with development.

The following instructions are summarized for installing Hummingbot from source on Windows 10, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Install Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux

Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for installing Windows Subsystem for Linux, and then Ubuntu.

2. Install Hummingbot on Linux Subsystem

![Bash for Windows](bash-for-windows.png)

You can install Hummingbot as shown below:

```Manual Installation
# 1) Navigate to root folder
cd ~

# 2) Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

# 3) Install Miniconda3
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# 4) Log out and log back into shell to register "conda" command
exit

# 5) Log back into or open a new Linux terminal

# 6) Clone Hummingbot
git clone https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot.git

# 7) Install Hummingbot
cd hummingbot && ./install

# 8) Activate environment and compile code
conda activate hummingbot && ./compile

# 9) Start Hummingbot
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Using Hummingbot

### What you'll need to start:

#### Crypto Inventory

**Why this is needed**: In order to run trading bot, you'll need some inventory of crypto assets available on the exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet (for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges).

Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`.

In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges. For more information, please see [Connectors](/connectors).

#### API Keys

**Why this is needed**: In order to run a bot on a centralized exchange like Binance, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process.

For more information on how to get the API keys for each exchange, please see the individual exchange pages in [Connectors](/connectors).

#### Ethereum Wallet

**Why this is needed**: In order to earn rewards from Liquidity Bounties, you need an Ethereum wallet. In addition, you'll need to import an Ethereum wallet when you run a trading bot on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.

For more information on creating or importing an Ethereum wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/advanced/wallet).

#### Ethereum Node (DEX only)

**Why this is needed**: When you run a trading bot on a Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, your wallet sends signed transactions to the blockchain via an Ethereum node.

For more information, see [Ethereum node](/installation/node/).
