## macOS <h4 id="macOS"></h4>

**Prerequisites**

This section walks you through how to prepare your development environment.

1. Install Xcode command line tools

Running Hummingbot on **macOS** requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and Xcode command line tools.

```
xcode-select --install
```

2. Install Anaconda3

Hummingbot requires Python 3 and other Python libraries. To manage these dependencies, Hummingbot uses Anaconda, an open source environment and package manager for Python that is the current industry standard for data scientists and data engineers.

To install Anaconda, go to [the Anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and download the **Python 3.7 installer** for your operating system. Both the graphical installer and the command line installer will work. Run the installer, and it will guide you through the installation process.

Afterwards, open a Terminal window and try the `conda` command. If the command is valid, then Anaconda has been successfully installed, even if the graphical installer says that it failed.

> Warning: If you use ZSH or another Unix shell, copy the code snippet below to your `.zshrc` or similar file. By default, Anaconda only adds it to your `.bash_profile` file. This makes the `conda` command available in your root path.

```
__conda_setup="$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    \eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base
    else
        \export PATH="/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
```

## Raspberry Pi

Running Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi has the same main benefit of running it on a cloud server: having a dedicated machine for Hummingbot. Raspberry Pi’s are relatively low cost, easy to set up, and, of course, don’t have the monthly charges associated with a cloud provider.

![rpi](rpi-hummingbot.jpg)

Read through our full blog post about [Deploying Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-07-deploying-hummingbot-on-a-raspberry-pi/).

The only way to currently install Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi is by downloading the source files from GitHub and compiling and running from source. This adds a few more steps than downloading binaries or running from Docker, but below we have provided a step-by-step guide to walk you through the process.

### Prerequisites

**Step 1. Install 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS**

To run Hummingbot on a Raspberry Pi, a 64-bit OS is required. Raspberry Pi has a beta 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS. You can download the OS from the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=117&t=275370).

**Step 2. Load the image file to your Raspberry Pi’s SD card**

Raspberry Pi has an easy to follow [guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) with alternatives on how to load the SD card with a Raspberry Pi OS from different operating systems.

**Step 3. Boot your Raspberry Pi**

Insert your SD card into the Raspberry Pi and plug in the power source. From there, the first launch options will be prompted.

### Install Hummingbot dependencies

**Step 1. Open the Raspberry Pi terminal**

In the top left corner of the desktop, there is a shortcut that opens the terminal.

**Step 2. Install Miniforge, Python and update alternatives**

```
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.sh
sh Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.sh
sudo apt-get install python3.7
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
```

**Step 3. Log out and Log back in to enable `conda`**

This will make the `conda` command available in shell / terminal.

### Install pip dependencies

**Step 1. Create a conda environment for Hummingbot**

```
conda create --name hummingbot
```

**Step 2. Activate your conda environment**

```
conda activate hummingbot
```

**Step 3. Install the pip dependencies**

```
pip install pandas cython cachetools aiohttp ruamel.yaml eth_account aiokafka sqlalchemy binance python-binance ujson websockets signalr-client-aio web3 prompt_toolkit 0x-order-utils 0x-contract-wrappers eth_bloom pyperclip telegram python-telegram-bot jwt numpy mypy_extensions
```

### Install, compile, and run Hummingbot

**Step 1. Clone the Hummingbot repo from Github**

```
git clone https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot.git
```

**Step 2. Clean your Hummingbot directory and compile**

```
cd hummingbot && ./clean && ./compile
```

**Step 3. Run Hummingbot**

```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

### Controlling remotely using VNC Viewer

SSH and VNC features are natively built into the Raspberry Pi and can easily be turned on in the Raspberry Pi configurations settings. By turning these on, you can access the Raspberry Pi from another computer by (1) using terminal to SSH, similar to how you would access a cloud server, or (2) using VNC to enable remote desktop access to the Raspberry Pi GUI. This is very convenient; after initial setup of the Raspberry Pi, you can simply unplug the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and just set the Raspberry Pi itself aside and just access it remotely going forward.

![rpi](rpi-ssh.jpg)

**Step 1. Enable SSH and VNC on your Raspberry Pi**

- Option 1: Terminal using raspi-config

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Under Interfacing Options, enable SSH and VNC.

- Option 2: Access in Raspberry Pi Configuration

Select the menu in the top left corner of the screen then go to **Preferences > Raspberry Pi configuration > Interfaces** from there you will see options to enable SSH and VNC.

![rpi](rpi-config.jpg)

> Tip: Set a default screen resolution in `raspi-config` select: `7 Advanced Options` > `A5 Resolution` to enable VNC access to the GUI whenever you boot the Raspberry Pi without a connected monitor. For troubleshooting please visit this [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=216737).

Setting a default resolution will avoid the following error:

![rasp](rasp-no-monitor.png)

**Step 2. Get your Raspberry Pi’s IP address**

Type `ifconfig` to get the IP address of your Raspberry Pi to enter into your VNC Viewer. For SSH, you can run `ssh pi@[ipaddress]`. The IP address is the `inet` address which is not the localhost IP address 127.0.0.1:

### What you'll need to start:

#### Crypto Inventory

**Why this is needed**: In order to run trading bot, you'll need some inventory of crypto assets available on the exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet (for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges).

Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`.

In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges. For more information, please see [Connectors](/connectors/overview).

#### API Keys

**Why this is needed**: In order to run a bot on a centralized exchange like Binance, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process.

For more information on how to get the API keys for each exchange, please see the individual exchange pages in [Connectors](/connectors/overview).

#### Ethereum Wallet

**Why this is needed**: In order to earn rewards from Liquidity Bounties, you need an Ethereum wallet. In addition, you'll need to import an Ethereum wallet when you run a trading bot on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.

For more information on creating or importing an Ethereum wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/operation/adv-command-ref).

#### Ethereum Node (DEX only)

**Why this is needed**: When you run a trading bot on a Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, your wallet sends signed transactions to the blockchain via an Ethereum node.

For more information, see [Ethereum node](/operation/adv-command-ref).
