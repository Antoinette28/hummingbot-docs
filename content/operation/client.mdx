Hummingbot uses a command-line interface (CLI) that helps users configure and run the bot, as well as generate logs of the trades performed.

## Starting Hummingbot

### Installed from Docker

Creating a new instance of Hummingbot with `docker run` will automatically start the Hummingbot client (see Docker installation guides for [Windows](/installation/docker/windows), [Linux](/installation/docker/linux) and [MacOS](/installation/docker/macOS)).

To run a previously created, stopped container where \$NAME is the name of your instance of Hummingbot:

```sh
docker start $NAME && docker attach $NAME
```

For additional information on useful commands, see the [commands](/operation/commands) to running Hummingbot on Docker.

### Installed from Source

> note: Make sure that you activate the Anaconda environment with `conda activate hummingbot` prior to running Hummingbot.

Open a Terminal window and go to the root of the directory that contains Hummingbot. From there, run:

```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## User Interface

### Client Layout

![Hummingbot CLI](hummingbot-cli.png)

The CLI is divided into three panes:

- **Input pane (lower left)**: where users enter commands
- **Output pane (upper left)**: prints the output of the user's commands
- **Log pane (right)**: log messages

## Srategy-specific Files

The `create` command walks you through the process of initializing and configuring the global and strategy-specific settings necessary to run the bot. Running the command will create the following files in the `conf/` folder:

| File                   | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf_global.yml`      | Global configuration settings, e.g. Binance API keys and Ethereum node.                              |
| `conf_arb_[#].yml`     | Settings for the [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage/) strategy.                                       |
| `conf_xemm_[#].yml`    | Settings for the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) strategy. |
| `conf_pure_mm_[#].yml` | Settings for the [pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making/) strategy.                     |

> Tip "Editing Configuration Files Directly": Once they are created, you may find it easier to edit the configuration files in the `conf/` folder. Simply open them with a text editor and make any desired modifications.

## Setup Walkthrough

When running `create`, you are asked to select a strategy and enter strategy-specific configuration parameters. We have developed walkthroughs for each strategy:

- [Arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage#configuration-walkthrough)
- [Cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making#configuration-walkthrough)
- [Pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making#configuration-walkthrough)

> Note "Essential Trading Considerations": When configuring your bot, make sure you are aware of your exchange's minimum order sizes and fees, and check that your trading pair has sufficient order book and trading volumes. You can find more info about specific exchanges in the [Connectors](/connectors) section.

## API keys

In order to trade on a centralized exchange, you will need to import your API key from that exchange to Hummingbot using the `connect [exchange_name]` command. API keys are account specific credentials that allow access to live information and trading outside of the exchange website.

Please see below for instructions to find your API keys for the exchanges that Hummingbot currently supports:

- [Binance](/connectors/binance/#creating-binance-api-keys)
- [Coinbase Pro](/connectors/coinbase/#creating-coinbase-pro-api-keys)
- [Huobi Global](/connectors/huobi/#creating-huobi-api-keys)
- [Bittrex Global](/connectors/bittrex/#creating-bittrex-api-keys)
- [Liquid](/connectors/liquid/#creating-liquid-api-keys)
- [KuCoin](/connectors/kucoin/#creating-kucoin-api-keys)
- [Kraken](/connectors/kraken/#creating-kraken-api-keys)
- [Eterbase](/connectors/eterbase/#creating-eterbase-api-keys)

> Warning: "API key permissions": We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent** is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies.

## Config File Templates

This configuration files created and used by Hummingbot are saved in the `conf/` directory of your instance, which you can edit directly with a standard text editor.

The template configuration files can be found here: [Config Templates](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/templates).

> Warning: Exit Hummingbot and ensure it is not running when you modify the config files. Changes will take effect the next time Hummingbot is started.
