import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout";

## Callout

The Callout component provides callouts to use it in any mdx file, to begin, first import the component.

```
import Callout from "{path from file}/src/components/Callout";
```

There are 6 different callout types: `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, `bug`, `note`. These are input for the Callout component's `type` prop, to render that type of callout. If no type is specificed the type `note` is set as default.

### Types

The Callout component uses identifiers in the input body string to support bold and highlighting. Similar to regular markdown, You can use tags ` `` ` to surround text in the body input string to highlight, or you can use tags `##` to surround text in the body input string to bold.

### Example Bold

```
<Callout type="success" body="#Binance Perpetual connector is released as beta version(0.33)#, trade it with your own risk. #Binance Perpetual# is different from futures contract, please see differences." />
```

```

### Example Embedded links

The Callout component also supports nested links. Similar to regular markdown, You can use opening tag `[` and closing tag `]` to surround the text in the body input string to hyperlink it. When using links it is **required** to add a `link` prop that takes in an array of link strings, which are associated to your `[]` identifiers order.

```
<Callout type="warning" body="Currently [dydx], [terra], and [loopring] don't work on Binary Installers. It can only be used when running Hummingbot from source or with Docker." link={["/exchange-connectors/dydx/","/protocol-connectors/terra","/exchange-connectors/loopring/"]}/>
```

If your inputs for identifier tags are not fully closed, or the number of links used don't match with the number of link tags used then the component will render a message to tell you which prop to fix.
